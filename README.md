# API Platform Cloud Service Training, Samples and Demos
This is the place to learn all about API Platform!  Here you will find our repository of tutorials that are aimed to help you on your path to be an expert.  

## What is a tutorial?
A tutorial is a small lesson that walks you through the process of performing a particular task.  For example [Designing an API](./tutorials/design/design_api)

Think of a tutorial as the *how to perform a task*

## What is a scenario?
A scenario the story or use-case that provides a path through the tutorials.  Think of a scenario as the *what and why*

## Suggested approach
The overall structure of this training can be thought of as

- Scenario
  - Tutorials
    - Screencasts (coming soon)

As you begin with the scenario, you may visit the linked tutorials for guidance, but we suggest you try to push yourself to use the application with only just enough guidance that you might need.  **Don't blindly follow the steps of a tutorial.**  As a matter of fact, there are some tasks that naturally get repeated, such as deploying an API as you make changes.  The first time you deploy, you may need to use the tutorial, but the second and subsequent times, try to do it without the tutorial so you can test yourself and confirm if you are comprehending what this training is teaching you.
