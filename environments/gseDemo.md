# GSE Demo Central
GSE provides the capabilities to set up API Platform for short-term demos.

Use http://demo.oracle.com.  Select "UCM with Classic Focus".  That will set up a cloud domain, which you can provision API Platform CS management Service.

You can also provision an IaaS Compute to install the gateway.

>Note: You will create an admin user as part of the provisioning process.  Using this admin user, you will need to log into the Weblogic console (after provisioning) and create users if you wish to showcase different user personas and the grants system.  Here it will be your choice of the users you create.
