# Scenarios
Scenarios are the framework of a lab exercise which includes a story that weaves tutorials together.  Essentially a scenario is the "What and Why" and the tutorials are the "How".  We are focused on one scenario only at this point, but if we choose to create other targeted labs, we can include them here as well.
